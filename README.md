# VideoEncoder

**VideoEncoder** is a simple and intuitive tool designed to merge multiple video streams into a single, viewable video file. It is especially useful for handling `.mp4` files that contain multiple video streams (up to 4), allowing you to choose which streams to display and how.

### 🔧 Features

- **Load multi-stream videos** – Import videos that contain between 1 and 4 separate video streams.
- **Stream selection** – Choose which streams (V1, V2, V3, V4) you want to include in the final output.
- **Optional image overlay** – Replace any video stream with a static image by enabling the "Use image" option.
- **View modes**:
  - **Dual mode** – Combine two streams side by side.
  - **Quad mode** – Display up to four streams (or three streams + an image) in a 2x2 grid.
- **Custom output name** – Set a custom name for the generated video.
- **One-click export** – Press "Create video" to generate your final encoded video.

### 🎯 Use Case

Let’s say you have a `.mp4` file with 3 separate video streams. With VideoEncoder, you can combine these into a single video file that shows all 3 streams simultaneously, either side-by-side (Dual) or in a 2x2 layout (Quad). You can even use a static image as a placeholder for one of the streams.
